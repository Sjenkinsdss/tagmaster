```

### Backend (Express.js)
```
Start Command: npm start
Port: 5000 (configurable via environment)
Database: Dual connection (Production + Replit)
Session Management: PostgreSQL-based sessions
```

### Database Configuration
```
Production DB: postgresql://tableau_reporting_user:***@encrypted-final-pg10-jan-1-2019.cydo4oi1ymxb.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/shelfdb
Replit DB: postgresql://neondb_owner:***@ep-lively-mountain-a5n56seb.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb
Connection Pool: 20 max connections per database
```

## Environment Variables Required

### Required for Production
```bash
# Database Connections
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tableau_reporting_user:***@encrypted-final-pg10-jan-1-2019.cydo4oi1ymxb.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/shelfdb
REPLIT_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:***@ep-lively-mountain-a5n56seb.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb

# Database Credentials (Auto-populated from DATABASE_URL)
PGHOST=encrypted-final-pg10-jan-1-2019.cydo4oi1ymxb.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=tableau_reporting_user
PGPASSWORD=***
PGDATABASE=shelfdb

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

### Optional for Enhanced Features
```bash
# AI Features (Currently not required but recommended)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-*** (for enhanced AI recommendations)
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Application
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build frontend
npm run build

# Verify build output
ls -la dist/
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Push database schema to Replit database
npm run db:push

# Verify database connections
node -e "require('./server/db.js')"
```

### 3. Start Production Server
```bash
# Start application
npm start

# Verify server is running
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/posts | jq '.posts | length'
```

### 4. Health Check Verification
```bash
# Test key endpoints
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/posts
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/tags
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/tag-categories
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Critical Functionality Tests
- [ ] Application loads at deployment URL
- [ ] All three columns display correctly
- [ ] Post selection updates interface
- [ ] Tag sections display with emojis
- [ ] Filters and search work correctly
- [ ] Pagination functions properly
- [ ] Database write protection active
- [ ] Error handling displays user-friendly messages

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Initial page load: <3 seconds
- [ ] Post selection: <500ms
- [ ] Filter operations: <1 second
- [ ] API responses: <500ms (except AI recommendations)
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-Critical)
1. **React Key Warnings**: Duplicate keys in post rendering
   - **Impact**: Console warnings only, no functional impact
   - **Fix**: Scheduled for future update

2. **AI Recommendations Performance**: 10+ second load times
   - **Impact**: Slow but functional AI recommendations
   - **Fix**: Performance optimization recommended

3. **Co-occurrence Queries**: Temporarily disabled
   - **Impact**: AI recommendations less accurate
   - **Fix**: Database schema investigation needed

### Read-Only Database Limitations
- **Expected Behavior**: Write operations return "READONLY_DATABASE" error
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages explain production database protection
- **Workaround**: New tags created in Replit database for testing

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
- Monitor API response times
- Track database connection status
- Watch for JavaScript errors
- Monitor memory usage patterns

### Regular Maintenance
- Weekly database connection verification
- Monthly performance analysis
- Quarterly security audit
- Tag data synchronization between databases

## Rollback Plan

### In Case of Issues
1. **Database Problems**: Fallback to cached data
2. **API Failures**: Graceful degradation with error messages
3. **Frontend Issues**: Previous version deployment available
4. **Performance Issues**: Scale database connections

### Emergency Contacts
- **Technical Issues**: Development team
- **Database Issues**: Database administrator
- **Security Issues**: Security team
