# Tagging Interface MVP

## Overview

This is a full-stack TypeScript application built for tagging social media content. It consists of a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, utilizing PostgreSQL as the database with Drizzle ORM for data management. The application serves as a tagging interface for social media posts, allowing users to categorize content with AI-generated and user-created tags, and manage linked paid advertisements.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a relational database with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Basic user authentication (though not required for MVP)
- **Posts**: Social media posts with platform, embed URLs, and metadata
- **Tags**: Categorized tags with auto-generated codes (pillar_tagname_####)
- **PostTags**: Many-to-many relationship between posts and tags
- **PaidAds**: Advertisements linked to posts
- **AdTags**: Many-to-many relationship between ads and tags

### Frontend Components
- **TaggingInterface**: Main interface with three-column layout
- **PostItem**: Individual post display with embedded media
- **TagSection**: Tag management for different pillars (product, influencer)
- **PaidAdItem**: Paid advertisement display with linking controls
- **TagInput**: Dynamic tag creation interface

### Backend Services
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted database operations through IStorage interface
- **Route Handlers**: RESTful endpoints for posts, tags, and ads
- **Database Connection**: Pooled connections with Neon serverless

## Data Flow

1. **Content Display**: Posts are fetched from the database and displayed in the left column with embedded media
2. **Tag Management**: Tags are organized by pillars (product, influencer) and can be AI-generated or user-created
3. **Tag Association**: Users can add/remove tags from posts, with automatic code generation for new tags
4. **Ad Linking**: Paid ads inherit tags from their linked posts by default but can be unlinked to break inheritance

### Tag Code Generation
- Format: `pillar_tagname_####` (e.g., "product_shoes_0001")
- Automatic generation ensures unique identification
- Stable internal codes for database consistency

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL provider
- **Connection**: WebSocket-based connection for serverless environments
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

### UI Framework
- **shadcn/ui**: Comprehensive component library built on Radix UI
- **Radix UI**: Accessible, unstyled UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with HMR
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the stack
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code formatting and linting
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment optimizations

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds the React application to `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: esbuild bundles the Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `db:push` command

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Uses `tsx` for TypeScript execution with hot reloading
- **Production**: Node.js serves the built application
- **Database**: Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### File Structure
- `client/`: React frontend application
- `server/`: Express backend application
- `shared/`: Shared TypeScript schemas and types
- `migrations/`: Database migration files
- `dist/`: Built application files

The application is designed to be deployed on platforms that support Node.js applications with PostgreSQL databases, with specific optimizations for Replit's development environment.
