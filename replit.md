# Tagging Interface MVP

## Overview

This is a full-stack TypeScript application built for tagging social media content. It consists of a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, utilizing PostgreSQL as the database with Drizzle ORM for data management. The application serves as a tagging interface for social media posts, allowing users to categorize content with AI-generated and user-created tags, and manage linked paid advertisements.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a relational database with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Basic user authentication (though not required for MVP)
- **Posts**: Social media posts with platform, embed URLs, and metadata
- **Tags**: Three-tier hierarchical tags with separate type, category, and name fields plus auto-generated codes (type_category_name_####)
- **PostTags**: Many-to-many relationship between posts and tags
- **PaidAds**: Advertisements linked to posts
- **AdTags**: Many-to-many relationship between ads and tags

#### Three-Tier Tag Hierarchy
All tags must follow the mandatory three-tier structure:
- **Type**: Primary classification (ad, campaign, client, post, ai, influencer)
- **Category**: Secondary classification within type (Vertical, Creative, etc.)
- **Name**: The actual tag identifier
- **Code**: Auto-generated unique identifier (type_category_name_####)

### Connected Tags Organization System
The interface displays tags connected to selected posts using a hierarchical Type → Category structure:

#### Data Structure
- **Production Tables**: Uses `debra_posts_influencer_tags` for post-tag relationships
- **Tag Information**: Fetched from `debra_influencertag` with optional category data from `debra_influencertagtype`
- **Fallback Handling**: Tags without category information are grouped as "Uncategorized"

#### Display Hierarchy
1. **Type Level**: Primary grouping by tag type (post, product, influencer, etc.)
   - Shows total count of tags in that type
   - Capitalized display name for clarity
   - Alphabetically sorted types

2. **Category Level**: Secondary grouping within each type
   - Uses tag_type_name from production database when available
   - Falls back to "Uncategorized" for tags without category relationships
   - Shows count of tags in each category
   - Alphabetically sorted categories within each type

3. **Individual Tags**: Final level showing actual tag names
   - Alphabetically sorted within each category
   - Displayed as small green badges for visual distinction
   - Uses production tag names from debra_influencertag table

#### Visual Implementation
- **Green Styling**: Connected tags use green color scheme to distinguish from browseable tags
- **Indentation**: Clear visual hierarchy with proper spacing and margins
- **Count Indicators**: Each level shows tag counts in parentheses for quick reference
- **Responsive Layout**: Flex-wrap design adapts to different screen sizes

#### Technical Implementation
The connected tags system is implemented in the TaggingInterface component with the following structure:

```typescript
// Data Flow
1. User selects a post → triggers API call to /api/posts/{id}/tags
2. Backend queries debra_posts_influencer_tags with LEFT JOIN to debra_influencertagtype
3. Frontend receives array of PostTag objects with nested tag information
4. JavaScript reduces tags into nested structure: Type → Category → Individual Tags
5. React renders hierarchical display with proper sorting and styling

// Key Functions
- getPostTags(): Fetches connected tags from production database
- Type grouping: Uses tag.pillar field for primary organization
- Category grouping: Uses tag.tag_type_name or fallback to "Uncategorized"
- Sorting: Alphabetical at all levels for consistency
```

#### Database Relationships
- **Primary Table**: `debra_posts_influencer_tags` (post_id, influencertag_id)
- **Tag Details**: `debra_influencertag` (id, name, tag_type_id)
- **Category Info**: `debra_influencertagtype` (id, name) via LEFT JOIN
- **Fallback Strategy**: When category relationships missing, displays as "Uncategorized"

This system provides users with clear visibility into existing tag associations while maintaining the ability to browse and add new tags through the category-based sections below.

### Frontend Components
- **TaggingInterface**: Main interface with three-column layout
- **PostItem**: Individual post display with embedded media
- **TagSection**: Tag management for different pillars (product, influencer)
- **PaidAdItem**: Paid advertisement display with linking controls
- **TagInput**: Dynamic tag creation interface

### Backend Services
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted database operations through IStorage interface with dual database support
- **Route Handlers**: RESTful endpoints for posts, tags, and ads with three-tier tag support
- **Database Connection**: Dual architecture with production (read-only) and Replit (writable) PostgreSQL databases
- **Tag Management**: Complete CRUD operations with three-tier hierarchy validation

## Data Flow

1. **Content Display**: Posts are fetched from the database and displayed in the left column with embedded media
2. **Tag Management**: Tags are organized by pillars (product, influencer) and can be AI-generated or user-created
3. **Tag Association**: Users can add/remove tags from posts, with automatic code generation for new tags
4. **Ad Linking**: Paid ads inherit tags from their linked posts by default but can be unlinked to break inheritance

### Tag Code Generation
- **Three-Tier Format**: `type_category_name_####` (e.g., "ad_vertical_shoes_0001")
- **Two-Tier Fallback**: `type_name_####` when no category specified
- **Legacy Format**: `pillar_name_####` for backwards compatibility
- Automatic generation ensures unique identification
- Stable internal codes for database consistency

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL provider
- **Connection**: WebSocket-based connection for serverless environments
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

### UI Framework
- **shadcn/ui**: Comprehensive component library built on Radix UI
- **Radix UI**: Accessible, unstyled UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with HMR
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the stack
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code formatting and linting
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment optimizations

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds the React application to `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: esbuild bundles the Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `db:push` command

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Uses `tsx` for TypeScript execution with hot reloading
- **Production**: Node.js serves the built application
- **Database**: Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### File Structure
- `client/`: React frontend application
- `server/`: Express backend application
- `shared/`: Shared TypeScript schemas and types
- `migrations/`: Database migration files
- `dist/`: Built application files

The application is designed to be deployed on platforms that support Node.js applications with PostgreSQL databases, with specific optimizations for Replit's development environment.
