🏷️ Tagging Interface MVP — Specification
🎯 Goal
Build a Tagging Interface that serves as the foundation for a future analytics hub. This MVP should prioritize usability and clarity, allowing users to tag content inline, quickly, and accurately.

✅ Core Features
📺 1. Content Column (Embedded Media)
* Display a list of social media posts (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.).
* Embed media so videos are playable inline — no external navigation.
* Users must be able to watch and tag simultaneously.
* Show post metadata:
    * Title
    * Timestamp
    * Campaign Name

🏷️ 2. Tagging Columns (Grouped by Pillar)
* Show tags in columns grouped by pillar:
    * Product Tags (category + tags)
    * Influencer Tags (category + tags)
* AI-generated tags should be pre-filled:
    * Users can edit, remove, or correct them.
* User-added tags must be:
    * Freeform input (MVP)
    * Automatically assigned a unique internal code in the format: pillar_tagname_####

📢 3. Connected Paid Ads Column
* Show paid ads linked to the post.
* Each ad:
    * Visually resembles original post (thumbnail, preview, etc.)
    * Inherits post tags by default.
    * Can be deselected/unlinked manually.
* Once unlinked:
    * Tag inheritance is broken — ad no longer syncs with post tags.

🧠 Back-End Logic
* All tags (AI or user-created) must have a stable internal code.
* Tag codes are stored in an existing PostgreSQL database.
* When a new tag is created:
    * System generates and stores a unique tag code automatically.
* When a paid ad is unlinked:
    * It stops inheriting any new tags added to the original post.

📌 Assumptions + Clarifications
Data + Storage
* PostgreSQL is the backend — no need to build new DB infra.
* Internal-only app; no authentication required for MVP.
Embeds & Metadata
* Supported platforms must allow embeddable URLs.
* Fallback UI is acceptable if native embedding fails.
* Metadata shown with each post:
    * Title, Timestamp, Campaign Name
Tags
* Tag categories (Product & Influencer) are fixed.
* Freeform input for new tags during MVP.
* Dropdowns/autocomplete will be introduced later where appropriate.
* AI tag generation is handled by a separate tool — integration not required for MVP.
Ads
* Multiple paid ads can be connected to a single post.
* Unlinking an ad disables all future tag inheritance.

🔭 Future Features (Out of Scope for MVP)
* Analytics hub: Select a tag + KPI and visualize results via charts.
* User behavior tracking for training or analysis.
* Tag suggestions based on correction history.
* Audit trail to track tag edit history/versioning.
